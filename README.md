# Coffee_Shop_Analysis_and_Predictions

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of over 5,000 specialty coffee reviews to uncover trends in sensory attributes, roast types, regions, and overall ratings. The data was cleaned, merged, and transformed to ensure consistency and usability. Feature engineering techniques were applied to convert categorical variables - such as roast level and region - into meaningful inputs for analysis. A machine learning model was developed to predict coffee ratings based on sensory attributes (such as flavor, aroma, acidity), as well as roast and region.The goal was to extract insights and build a predictive model. I also created a Tableau dashboard to visualize key trends and insights. Additionally, I developed a business memo summarizing key findings and strategic recommendations.
